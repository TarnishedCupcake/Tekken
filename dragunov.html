    <h1>Comprehensive Dragunov Guide ‚Äì Part 1: Introduction</h1>

    <h2>Archetype Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Dragunov is a <strong>Pressure Grappler / Control Brawler</strong> who thrives at close range. He excels in forcing turn-based interactions through relentless frame traps, strong command throws, and tight mid-check pressure. While his approach tools are linear, once in, he can condition opponents into high-risk guessing games using SNK transitions and Heat-enhanced pressure.
    </p>

    <h2>Execution Tier</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Moderate Difficulty.</strong> Dragunov requires clean buffering (especially for WR/F+2,1), SNK cancel usage, fast reaction to counter-hits, and advanced movement to maintain pressure while denying opponent retaliation. His ceiling scales dramatically with Heat optimization and matchup-specific timing traps.
    </p>

    <h2>Strengths</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>+ Frames on key strings (e.g., F+2,1, 1,2~SNK)</li>
      <li>Outstanding CH reward from mids (e.g., CH B+1)</li>
      <li>Wall carry with reliable enders into spike oki</li>
      <li>Strong throw mix with Oki pressure on break</li>
      <li>SNK stance creates a layered offense system</li>
      <li>Heat routing adds pressure resets and damage</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Weaknesses</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Linear approach tools ‚Äî weak tracking mids</li>
      <li>Can be sidestepped Right post-SNK or F+2,1</li>
      <li>Has no real 50/50 launcher threat</li>
      <li>Struggles against life-lead turtles</li>
      <li>Relies on frame traps, not mix, to open up</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Offensive Game Plan</h2>
    <p>
      Dragunov thrives on pressure cycles ‚Äî abusing frame advantage to set up stance transitions or reset with throws. Heat Dash after F+2,1 or 1,2~SNK lets him force mix layers. Use delay timing on SNK 2 to catch fuzzy defense, or threaten tick throws to collapse opponent guard. At the wall, SNK 1 ‚Üí throw becomes a deadly loop.
    </p>

    <h2>Defensive Game Plan</h2>
    <p>
      On defense, Dragunov favors spacing traps and counter-hit punishes. B+1 and D/F+2 are key for interrupting pressure. Use backdash into SNK cancel for baiting jabs or mids, and WS+4 to safely interrupt risky lows. In Heat, leverage armor trades to reverse momentum when behind.
    </p>

    <h2>Playstyle Profiles</h2>
    <h3>üî• Aggressive Enforcer</h3>
    <p>
      Prioritize +frames into SNK pressure. Loop 1,2~SNK and F+2,1 to maintain turn. Mix in throws or Heat Dash to stay unpredictable.<br>

    </p>

    <h3>üßä Poke Control Specialist</h3>
    <p>
      Play compact. Use D/F+1, 1,2, D+2 to frustrate the opponent into taking risks. Punish with B+1 or D/F+2.<br>

    <h3>üõ°Ô∏è Defensive Grappler</h3>
    <p>
      Hold life leads, punish mistakes, and shut down aggression with counter-hit tools and throw interrupts. Strong vs aggressive players.<br>

    <h2>Tournament Viability</h2>
    <p>
      Dragunov is a <strong>high-ceiling, high-control character</strong> with flexible tools for neutral, pressure, and defensive play. He thrives in bracket play due to his consistent punish damage, throw game, and ability to maintain control with +frames and SNK pressure. Mastery of stance flow, Heat optimization, and matchup reads elevates Dragunov from strong to dominating.
